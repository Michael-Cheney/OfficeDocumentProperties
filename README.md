# OfficeDocumentProperties
Used to view, edit &amp; delete the extended properties from Microsoft Office Documents

Most of the code here has been borrowed from https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/heyscriptingguy/2008/10/09/hey-scripting-guy-how-can-i-read-microsoft-excel-metadata/

Looking to further extend upon the functionality to include other Microsoft Office documents (Currently only Excel is supported and only read).
